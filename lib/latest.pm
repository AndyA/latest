latest - Use the latest Perl features

=head1 VERSION

This document describes latest version 0.03

=cut

our $VERSION = '0.03';

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use latest;
  
=head1 DESCRIPTION

The line

  use latest;

is roughly equivalent to

  use strict;
  use warnings;
  use $];

except that 'use $]' doesn't work.

The main use case is to

  use latest;

at the top of your tests to shake out any obscure problems that might
result from your code being used by a program that requires the latest
Perl version.

sub import {
  strict->import;

  }
}
